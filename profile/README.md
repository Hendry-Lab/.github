## The Hendry Lab

*Welcome to the Hendry lab at Cornell University!*

We study host-microbe interactions at the intersection of evolution, ecology and microbiology. The lab studies a broad range of questions focused on how host interactions shape bacterial genomes and communities, as well as how bacteria influence hosts. We employ varied techniques in genomics and ecological experiments to study host-microbe interactions in a variety of systems, including interactions of plants, insects and bacteria, bioluminescent symbiosis and host associated microbiomes.

We are located in the [Department of Microbiology](https://cals.cornell.edu/microbiology) at Cornell.
